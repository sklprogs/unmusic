- Deleting albums and quitting removes them from GUI but not from DB
- Modify fields, search a keyword, go to previous record with this keyword -
  modifications are not stored.
- Search tracks: Ctrl+Home and Ctrl+End do not work if the layout is not
  clicked.
- logic.Track.set_info: 'str' object is not callable
- DB.has_album does not always work as expected.
- Track comment seems not to be added to SEARCH (track search does not work)
- Search for artist, go to 4283, move EP to bottom, search again -> not saved
