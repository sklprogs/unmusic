This program deletes all tags and embedded images from your music files, renames files and folders to completely obscure media data. This can be useful if you wish to treat the music you have on your wearable players impartially, without the influence of bright titles or images. Your album folders will be renamed according to an album ID stored in the internal database, so you can easily retrieve tags if you want to. You also can modify tags stored in the database, rate separate tracks or entire albums, etc.
